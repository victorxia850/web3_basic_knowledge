# Cryptographic Techniques Used in Bitcoin

Bitcoin leverages cryptographic primitives to ensure security, trust, and integrity in a decentralized system. Two of the most important techniques are **hash functions** and **digital signatures**.

## 1. Hash Functions

Cryptographic hash functions map input data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size output. Bitcoin uses them in block creation, transaction integrity, and mining.

### 1.1 Collision Resistance

> It is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs $x_1 \neq x_2$ such that $H(x_1) = H(x_2)$.

**Use in Bitcoin**: Prevents data tampering. Any change in transaction data results in a completely different hash.

### 1.2 Hiding

> Given $H(x)$, it is infeasible to determine $x$.

**Enhancement**: Use of a random salt $r$: $H(r || x)$ to increase entropy.

**Use in Bitcoin**: Ensures that sensitive values are protected and irrecoverable from their hashes.

### 1.3 Puzzle Friendliness

> It is computationally difficult to find a value $x$ such that $H(x) < T$, where $T$ is a target.

**Use in Bitcoin**: Miningâ€”finding a nonce such that the hash of the block header is below a certain threshold.

                                      Is H < Target?
                                             â†“
                                         Yes â†’ Block Valid
                                          No â†’ Try Next Nonce
```

## 2. Digital Signatures

Bitcoin uses asymmetric cryptography to ensure that only the rightful owner of a private key can authorize a transaction.

### 2.1 Key Pair

* **Private Key**: Used to sign messages or transactions.
* **Public Key**: Shared with others to verify the signature.

### 2.2 Signing Process

1. Transaction data is signed with the sender's private key.
2. The network uses the public key to verify the signature.
3. If valid, the transaction is accepted.

[Sender's Private Key] â†’ [Sign Transaction] â†’ [Signature]
                                              â†“
[Transaction + Signature + Public Key] â†’ [Verify Signature]
                                              â†“
                                        Valid? â†’ Accept / Reject
```
